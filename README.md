Video games are big business: the global gaming market is projected to be worth more than $300 billion by
2027 according to Mordor Intelligence. With so much money at stake, the major game publishers are hugely
incentivized to create the next big hit. But are games getting better, or has the golden age of video games
already passed?
In this project, we will analyze video game critic and user scores as well as sales data for the top 400 video
games released since 1977. We will search for a golden age of video games by identifying release years that
users and critics liked best, and you'll explore the business side of gaming by looking at game sales data.
Our search will involve joining datasets and comparing results with set theory. we will also filter, group, and
order data. The database contains two
tables. Each table has been limited to 400 rows for this project, but you can find the complete dataset with
over 13,000 games on Kaggle.
